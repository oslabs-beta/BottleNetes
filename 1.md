All the insturctions were provided in readme-docerk.md. I am confused about the port. In docker-compose-dev-hot.yml it says - '8080:8080' for dev service using ${DOCKER_ORG}/mm-dev, and in docker_compose-test.yml it's 3000:3000. but the dev one runs the dev server right? SHouldn't it also be 3000? In webpack.config what is the meaning of proxy for devserver? Are we running the dev server at 3000 or 8080?

Clarifying Port Configuration and DevServer Proxy
Ports in docker-compose-dev-hot.yml and docker-compose-test.yml:

Development (docker-compose-dev-hot.yml):

Port Mapping: '8080:8080'
Purpose: Runs the webpack-dev-server on port 8080 inside the container and maps it to port 8080 on the host machine. This setup facilitates features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smoother development experience.
Testing (docker-compose-test.yml):

Port Mapping: '3000:3000'
Purpose: Runs the application server on port 3000 inside the container and maps it to port 3000 on the host machine. This configuration is typically used to mimic the production environment for testing purposes.
Understanding the proxy in webpack.config.js:

Proxy Configuration:
Meaning:
DevServer Port: The webpack-dev-server is running on port 8080.
Proxy Role: Any API requests (e.g., /api/\*) made to the dev server on port 8080 are proxied to the backend server running on port 3000. This allows the frontend to communicate with the backend seamlessly during development without encountering cross-origin issues.
Summary:

Development Environment:

Frontend (webpack-dev-server): Runs on 8080.
Backend Server: Runs on 3000.
Proxy: Routes API calls from 8080 to 3000.
Testing Environment:

Both frontend and backend run on port 3000, aligning with production settings.
This configuration ensures a clear separation between development and testing environments while facilitating smooth communication between frontend and backend services.
